# CustomForegroundLogo
I learnt how to create Flashpoint themes to deliver a single [punchline](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/875331458166824970/1003834329690030171/unknown.png).

Extract the zip in releases to the `Data\Themes` of your Flashpoint folder; be wary non-transparent images will cover a curation's logo.

Tutorial based in Obelisk's Custom Background Image theme.
